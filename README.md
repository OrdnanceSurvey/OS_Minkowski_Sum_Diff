A Java Library for computing Minkwoski Sum (A⊕B) and Minkwoski Difference (A⊖B) between two geometry A and B, built on top of JTS (Java Topology Suite).

Note that A⊕(-B) which is widely used for collision detection, is also referred to by some as Minkowski Difference. It is, however, in fact a Minkowski sum operation.
